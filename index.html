      <p>Hello! I am Reagan Otema from Jinja, Uganda. I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Development online at BYU–Idaho. I’m passionate about learning and applying web development skills to real-world projects.</p>
      <p>
        I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and create opportunities. As a lifelong learner, I embrace challenges and enjoy collaborating with others to build innovative solutions. Outside of coding, I am deeply committed to personal growth, community service, and fostering a positive impact through my work.

      <h2>About Uganda</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Flag_of_Uganda.svg" alt="Flag of Uganda" width="250" />
      <p>Uganda is a beautiful country located in East Africa. Known as the "Pearl of Africa," it boasts stunning landscapes, wildlife, and warm, friendly people. From the source of the Nile in Jinja to the lush national parks, Uganda offers a rich cultural and natural heritage. English is the official language, and the nation is known for its resilience, talent, and innovation.</p>
      <p>
        Uganda's vibrant culture, diverse traditions, and breathtaking natural wonders inspire me every day. Its spirit of unity and progress continues to fuel the ambitions of young professionals like myself, driving us to contribute meaningfully to our communities and the global stage.
